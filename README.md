# Weight-Tracker
WebApp for rendering linear regression models by bodyweight, MVC server with Nodejs and SKLearn microservice in Flask

## About
I am currently in the middle of a diet, and being a nerd i couldnÂ´t just do the diet without making a webapp that would help me track and predict future weights. Luckily i had about two rather slow weeks in school, which enabled me to play around during the evenings to put this application together during theese two weeks.

## W.I.P
Documentation is a work in progress.
